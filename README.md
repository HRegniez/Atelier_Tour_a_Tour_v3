# Atelier Tour à Tour

This website was created for a friend's new business. React and Sass were chosen for frontend development to sharpen my skills with these languages.

The backend now utilizes Supabase for authentication, database management, and storage. The gallery feature is currently in development, with a focus on optimizing performance and user experience.
